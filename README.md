# Combination-of-Clustering-Classification-Models
This project is divided in two separate parts. In the first one we build a clustering algorithm to group power consumption data of TV in three different houses. 
In the second part we build and train a classification model to be able to predict if the TV in On or not, based on the time of usage and the overall electric 
consumption for each house.
